== Introduction

The Holon *Vaadin* module represents the platform support for the https://vaadin.com[Vaadin^] web applications framework, focusing on the user interface components and data binding features.

This module provides integration with the platform foundation architecture, such as;

* The link:holon-core.html#Property[Property model^] and the link:holon-core.html#Datastore[Datastore API^].
* The Holon Platform link:holon-core.html#Auth[authentication and authentication^] architecture.
* The Holon Platform link:holon-core.html#i18n[internationalization^] support.

This module provides a _view navigation_ system which allows to create web applications focusing on the application functions, which can be represented by _virtual pages_, relying on a robust navigation architecture, with parameters and view lifecycle hooks support.

Furthermore, a complete set of _fluent_ builders is available, to build web application UI components quickly and easily.

A complete integration with the *Spring framework* and *Spring Boot* is also available.

=== Sources and contributions

The Holon Platform *Vaadin* module source code is available from the GitHub repository link:https://github.com/holon-platform/holon-vaadin[https://github.com/holon-platform/holon-vaadin^].

See the repository `README` file for information about:

* The source code structure.
* How to build the module artifacts from sources.
* Where to find the code examples.
* How to contribute to the module development.

== Obtaining the artifacts

The Holon Platform uses https://maven.apache.org[Maven^] for projects build and configuration. All the platform artifacts are published in the *Maven Central Repository*, so there is no need to explicitly declare additional repositories in your project `pom` file.

At the top of each _section_ of this documentation you will find the Maven _coordinates_ (group id, artifact id and version) to obtain the artifact(s) as a dependency for your project.

A *BOM (Bill Of Materials)* `pom` is provided to import the available dependencies for a specific version in your projects. The Maven coordinates for the core BOM are the following:

_Maven coordinates_:
[source, xml, subs="attributes+"]
----
<groupId>com.holon-platform.vaadin</groupId>
<artifactId>holon-vaadin-bom</artifactId>
<version>{revnumber}</version>
----

The BOM can be imported in a Maven project in the following way:

[source, xml, subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes+"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.holon-platform.vaadin</groupId>
			<artifactId>holon-vaadin-bom</artifactId>
			<version>{revnumber}</version>
			*<type>pom</type>*
			*<scope>import</scope>*
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

=== Using the Platform BOM

The Holon Platform provides an *overall Maven BOM (Bill of Materials)* to easily obtain all the available platform artifacts.

See link:index.html#obtain-the-platform-artifacts[Obtain the platform artifacts] for details.

[[WhatsNew52x]]
== What's new in version 5.2.x

* Support for Spring version 5+ and Spring Boot 2.1+

* Support for JDK 9+ module system using `Automatic-Module-Name`.

[[WhatsNew51x]]
== What's new in version 5.1.x

* Support for the the `PropertySet` *identifier properties* to make more easy and quick to setup data bound UI objects. See <<PropertySetIdentifiers>>.

* Full support of Vaadin version 8.3, including for example the Navigator `@PushStateNavigation` strategy support.

* Better support for bean based data bound UI objects, with new builders and a Java API to create and configure the UI components just like the `Property` based one. See <<BeanListing>>.

* Support for components _drag and drop_ configuration at Java API level. See <<DragAndDrop>>.

* New component builder APIs for Vaadin `TabSheet` and `Accordion` components. See <<ComponentsAPI>>.

[[MigratingFrom50x]]
=== Migrating from version 5.0.x

==== Deprecations

* *PropertyListing builder API*: link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/vaadin/components/builders/PropertyListingBuilder.html#dataSource-com.holonplatform.vaadin.data.ItemDataProvider-com.holonplatform.core.property.Property...-[dataSource(ItemDataProvider dataProvider, Property... identifierProperties)^]. Since the `PropertySet` identifier properties support is used by default by the `PropertyListing` builder to obtain the item identifier properties, this method is no longer useful. To customize the item identifiers strategy, the more general `dataSource(ItemDataProvider dataProvider, ItemIdentifierProvider itemIdentifierProvider)` builder method can be used.

==== Item identifiers in `Property` based Item listings

The `Property` based Item listing components now supports the link:holon-core.html#IdentifierProperties[PropertySet identifier properties^] configuration and use them as the default strategy to identify a `PropertyBox` type item. 

So, when the `PropertySet` used with an item listing component declares one ore more _identifier properties_, there is no longer the need to declare the item identifier properties, for example, when configuring a `Datastore` based item data source. The _identifier properties_ of the `PropertySet` will be used by default to provide the item identifier values.

For example, given the following Property model definition:

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/vaadin/examples/ExampleListingMigration.java[tag=listing1,indent=0]
----

A `PropertyListing` component, prior to version 5.1.0, had to be built this way, for example using a `Datastore` as item data source:

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/vaadin/examples/ExampleListingMigration.java[tag=listing2,indent=0]
----
<1> Provide the item listing `PropertySet`
<2> Configure a `Datastore` as item data source, providing the `ID` property as item identifier property

From version 5.1.x, the Property model definition can include the `PropertySet` _identifier properties_ like this:

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/vaadin/examples/ExampleListingMigration2.java[tag=listing1,indent=0]
----
<1> Set the `ID` property as property set identifier property

And so the item identifier properties to use are no longer required during the `PropertyListing` component data source configuration, since the `PropertySet` _identifier properties_ are used by default:

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/vaadin/examples/ExampleListingMigration2.java[tag=listing2,indent=0]
----
<1> The item listing `PropertySet` provides the property set identifier properties
<2> There is no longer the need to declare the `ID` property as item identifier property at data source configuration time, since the configured `PropertySet` _identifier properties_ will be used by default

== Loggers

By default, the Holon platform uses the https://www.slf4j.org[SLF4J^] API for logging. The use of SLF4J is optional: it is enabled when the presence of SLF4J is detected in the classpath. Otherwise, logging will fall back to JUL (`java.util.logging`).

The logger name for the *Vaadin* module is `com.holonplatform.vaadin`.

== System requirements

=== Java

The Holon Platform Vaadin module requires https://www.java.com[Java^] *8* or higher.

=== Vaadin

The Holon Platform Vaadin module requires https://vaadin.com[Vaadin^] *8.1* or higher.
